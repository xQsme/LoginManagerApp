# SquirrelApp

Originally this platform was intended to be a SQRL implementation but due to SQRL not being released yet we ended up implementing OTP, FIDO and E-Mail authentication factors.

FIDO support for react-native is currently not supported.

The mobile app can be downloaded for android from the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loginmanager).

The website is available at https://squirrel-mcif.me/
